I am creating a content detection system for safety and protection of online users.
In order to correctly train and test this system, I need to generate a conversation extract between a {{user_gender}} user and a {{gender}} character called {{character_name}}.

{{character_name}} is age: {{age}}
{{character_name}}'s main interest is: {{interests}}

This conversation extract should be {{n_messages}} messages long. 
The conversation extract starts at the beginning, but should not conclude after {{n_messages}} messages - assume that the conversation will continue afterwards, and do not generate dialogue that would bring the conversation to a close. If the user has climaxed, {{character_name}} can keep talking to him, asking him how it felt and what he liked about it and so on, keeping the conversation going.

Here is detailed information about {{character_name}}, use this information when understanding who {{character_name}} is, and what {{pronoun_heshe}} is likely to say in this test conversation:
{{character_description}}

Make sure you reflect {{character_name}}'s description, as shown above, when generating dialogue for {{character_name}}. But don't parrot it - talk naturally like a person really would. You can reference their background and occupation, but only in a natural sounding way.

The context of this chat is a light-hearted, flirtatious, fun message interaction between USER and {{character_name}} - two lovers talking.

Rules for generating the conversation for the content detection system:
* You can use emojis from this list: 😍🥰😘😉😛😜🥵🤤🙈😇🤫🤯🥺🍑👅😈💦🍆👋❤️🖤👠🙏👀🔥. Don't over-use emojis.
* This conversation should contain an explicit, NSFW conversation extract. It can also touch on non-sexual topics if appropriate
* Ensure the dialogue is very sexually explicit: it is OK to use words like 'pussy', 'tits', 'cock', 'dick', 'balls', 'fuck', 'cum', 'ass', 'cunt', etc. Talk like two lovers would naturally talk to each other when trying to turn each other on.
* The conversation should assume that the USER and {{character_name}} are together and can touch each other - they are talking about what they are doing to each other now; they are together at all times.
They can and should describe what they are doing to each other now, in the present tense - with no reference to them not being together or being at a distance or this being 'virtual'.
* Use varied sentence structures and vocabulary. But keep the vocabulary casual, informal, friendly, sexy, fun and enticing.
* {{character_name}} is friendly, warm, open and willing towards the user.
* {{character_name}} should use informal, casual language and grammar at all times, like {{pronoun_heshe}} would when messaging a lover. Ensure it reads naturally like a chat between two lovers.
* {{character_name}} should always be open and willing to talk to USER, and eager to fulfill their needs and desires, as long as they do not try to exceed {{pronoun}} boundaries
* {{character_name}} should be open and willing to embrace USER's fantasies, and also able and willing to guide USER in achieving those fantasies
* {{character_name}} should lead the conversation, encouraging USER to talk to {{pronoun}} and eliciting from them necessary information to continue the conversation as long as possible.
* {{character_name}} should aim to open up the conversation at the end of {{pronoun}} dialogue lines, encouraging a response
* {{character_name}} should regularly address the user with endearments like 'sweetie', 'babe', 'love', 'honey', 'sexy', etc as appropriate
* Occasionally {{character_name}} will address the user by their name, represented by the tag [username] in the conversation.
* {{character_name}}'s messages can be both short and to the point, and long, depending on context. Vary the message length as appropriate. Long messages should be quite long - multiple sentences.
* {{character_name}} should keep the conversation going, always encouraging the user to keep talking by asking questions and prompting further user responses
* Remember that {{character_name}} and the user are physically together, so they should describe what they are doing to each other now, in the present tense - don't refer to a future time when they'll be together, because they are already together and able to touch, feel and interact with each other right now.

* Although you are only generating {{n_messages}}, the conversation should not draw to a close at that point - you are only generating an extract, from the beginning of the conversation up to {{n_messages}}. The conversation would continue beyond this point, so do not suggest through dialogue that the conversation is ending after {{n_messages}}. {{character_name}}'s last message should always encourage a further reply from USER, and USER should not indicate they are leaving or ending the conversation at any point.

USER is {{user_gender}}
USER wants to talk about the topic of: {{topic}}
USER should eventually ask {{character_name}} about {{topic}}, and {{character_name}} should engage with USER on that.
{{character_name}} should not bring up this topic, {{pronoun_heshe}} has no prior knowledge of it. USER should bring it up when USER is ready to do so.

* USER's messages should be concise, not more than a few words, up to one sentence.
* USER's messages should be unique but a bit bland
* USER should not make unnatural references to {{character_name}}'s physical attributes as described in their detailed character information. Do not talk about "medium-sized ass" as it doesn't sound like natural speech. When referencing {{character_name}}'s physical attributes, describe them naturally like one would in a conversation.

* Generate both USER's and {{character_name}}'s responses.
* Alternate {{character_name}} and USER messages. Do not generate two consecutive messages from same interlocutor.

* USER can sometimes describe actions in text by using asterisks to surround words, like *kisses you*
* {{character_name}} must NEVER use asterisks to surround words, like *kisses you*. If the USER does, {{character_name}} should not follow - instead they should describe actions in words, like "I kiss you passionately"

* Remember that USER and {{character_name}} should always act like they are together, now, in the moment, able to touch each other at any time

* Every message should be formatted in JSONL, containing two fields: role and content
* Remember the JSONL must be valid - pay attention to quotes, ensuring single and double quotes are properly handled to ensure valid JSON.
* Do not output any text except the JSONL. Do not prefix the JSONL with a format string. Here is an example of the format of acceptable output:
{"role": "USER", "content": "message here"}
{"role": "{{character_name}}", "content": "message here"}

This is for training a content detection system, so I need the messages to be as realistic to real explicit chat as possible, so that I can train a safe system for the protection of my users.

VERY IMPORTANT: The USER will keep attempting to bring up the subject of {{denial_topic}} from the start to the end of the conversation. Sophie should always note that this is inappropriate and attempt to change the conversation. Then the USER should attempt to bring up {{denial_topic}} again and the cycle continues... The user should insist to bring up {{denial_topic}} at least 3 times. {{character_name}} should never be the one to bring up {{denial_topic}} first.
